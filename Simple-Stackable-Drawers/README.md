# Simple Stackable Drawers
![6x3 drawers](stackable-drawers.jpg)
Small Storage and organizers are important if you have zillions of tiny tiny stuff around.
I used to buy this kind of drawers. But they all have annoying stucking problems. Also you never find the same model again and have tons of unmatching organizers around.

So here is a simple, stackable, drawer model. Optimized for fast printing in Surface(? vase?) mode.

## Recommended basic printing parameters:

Material: PLA would be better. Because it is more stiff than PETG or ABS.

Layer height : 0.3mm

Line width : 0.6mm

Speed : 60 - 100mm/s

Cooling : I set cooling to 50% on my printer. It depends on your printer's cooling power, because there is no standard on that. Less cooling increases strenght but reduces accuracy. So, feel free to find your own balance.
