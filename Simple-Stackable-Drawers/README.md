# Simple Stackable Drawers
Small Storage and organizers are important if you have zillions of tiny tiny stuff around.
I used to buy this kind of drawers. But they all have annoying stucking problems. Also you never find the same model again and have tons of unmatching organizers around.

So here is a simple, stackable, drawer model. Optimized for fast printing in Surface(? vase?) mode.

Recommended basic printing parameters:

Layer height : 0.3mm

Line width : 0.6mm

Speed : 60 - 100mm/s
